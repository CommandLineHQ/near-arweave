# near-arweave

This is a collection of resources for building on NEAR and Arweave. 

## Arweave
[Docs](https://docs.arweave.org/info/)
[Wiki](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/main) (Note: This seems to sometimes break on Firefox. If that happens, try using Brave, Chrome, or some other Chromium based browser)
[Build with Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/build)

## NEAR
[NEAR RPC Endpoints](https://docs.near.org/docs/api/rpc)
[NEAR Complete Documentation](https://docs.near.org/)
[Decentralized storage solutions](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/storage-solutions)


Note that it is usually expensive to store data on the blockchain, so any data that does not need to be stored their is usually stored on either a centralized (eg Dropbox) or decentralized (eg IPFS, Arweave, Akash) storage system.
