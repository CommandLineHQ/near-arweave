This is a collection of resources for building on NEAR and Arweave.

## NEAR
[NEAR RPC Endpoints](https://docs.near.org/docs/api/rpc)
[NEAR Complete Documentation](https://docs.near.org/)
[Decentralized storage solutions](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/storage-solutions)

Note that it is usually expensive to store data on the blockchain, so any data that does not need to be stored their is usually stored on either a centralized (eg Dropbox) or decentralized (eg IPFS, Arweave, Akash) storage system.
